        "Abstract": "One of the key challenges of data management for smart manufacturing is dealing with data originating from both physical processes and virtual digital technologies. As image and sensor-based production monitoring deliver a wealth of data along the process chain, artificial intelligence (AI) enables enhanced data analysis and new insight regarding relevance of observed process deviations. With constantly increased availability of data from manifold and specific sources, the complexity and heterogeneity of information structures are also growing rapidly. This is especially true for highly variable research, scale-up, and pilot production, which poses new demands on data acquisition, data management, and data preprocessing. Herein, a unified framework for integrating an ontology and graph-based data space with data acquisition and data analytics to improve data consistency, documentation of workflows, as well as the reproducibility of observations and results is presented. The framework consists of several open-source web services that form an ontology-based data space where physical and virtual process chains are represented by a semantic data fabric built from findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable resource descriptions framework self-descriptions. The feasibility of the proposed framework is demonstrated for a laboratory-scale Li-ion battery cell production facility with AI applied to two data analytics use cases.",

The implementation of a data space in Mallorca is based on understanding the available data and identifying the problems that can be solved using them. The use of data through data spaces will contribute to the transformation of destinations into smart tourism destinations. Smart tourism destinations are considered as smart cities in which the tourism industry offers a new layer of complexity in which technologies, digitalization, and intelligence are powered by data. This study analyzes four scenarios in which geo-dashboards are developed: flood exposure of tourist accommodation, land-cover changes, human pressure, and tourist uses in urban areas. The results of applying the geo-dashboards to these different scenarios provide tourists and destination managers with valuable information for decision-making, highlighting the utility of this type of tool, and laying the foundations for a future tourism data space in Mallorca.",

Most formats have been created to enable specific and innovative applications. On the other hand, the available data models present a certain degree of complexity in terms of their integration and management due to partial overlaps, and in most cases, they could be exploited alternatively to implement the same smart and latest innovative solutions. This paper offers an overview of data models, standards and their relationships. A second contribution highlights any possible exploitation of data models for implementing operational processes for city transportation management and for the feeding of simulation and optimization processes that produce other data results in other data models. The final goal in most cases is the monitoring and control of city transport conditions, as well as the tactic and strategic planning of city infrastructure. This work was developed in the context of the CN MOST, a national center of sustainable mobility in Italy, and it is based on exploiting the Snap4City platform.",

        "Abstract": "The rapid expansion of digital twin technology has revolutionized management and testing across various sectors, particularly in safeguarding critical infrastructure like smart grids. Aligned with the NIS2 Directive, Directive (EU) 2022/2555 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 December 2022, digital twins play a critical role in bolstering cybersecurity measures by enabling advanced simulation and real-time monitoring, key aspects emphasized in the directive for enhancing the security of networks and information systems. Concurrently, Europe’s shift towards communal data spaces amplifies the need for robust cyber defences. This paper aims to bolster cybersecurity defences in critical infrastructure, with a particular focus on the energy sector and smart grids. It proposes an innovative architecture for cybersecurity monitoring, converting a Common Information Model-compliant system into a digital twin via the FIWARE platform and incorporating an open-source Security Information and Event Management solution. Validated by a real-world case study, our approach demonstrates significant advancements in protecting smart grids against cyber threats.",

        "Abstract": "Agriculture is one of the major sectors of the global economy and also a software-intensive domain. The digital landscape of agriculture is composed of multiple digital ecosystems, which together constitute an agricultural domain ecosystem, also referred to as the “Agricultural Data Space’’ (ADS). As the domain is so huge, there are several sub-domains and specialized solutions, and each of them poses challenges to interoperability. Additionally, farmers have increasing concerns about data sovereignty. In the context of the research project COGNAC, we elicited architecture drivers for interoperability and data sovereignty in agriculture and designed a reference architecture of a platform that aims to address these qualities in the ADS. In this paper, we present the solution concepts and design decisions that characterize the reference architecture. Early prototypes have been developed and made available to support the validation of the concept.",

To help to address this issue this paper provides the conceptual design of a Digital Product Passport based circular supply management system. To enable the recovery of critical raw materials at component and material levels for reuse and recycling. The works include an assessment of existing critical raw materials information management and an information needs identification survey, with 10 manufacturers, producer responsibility organisations, collectors and recyclers. The needs were used to generate 14 key product information management processes and exchanges that when implemented form a Digital Product Passport based circular supply management system. Information managed via a physical-digital linkage through individual product tags includes product registrations, materials declarations, life cycle status updates, the sorting of products at collection points based on critical raw material contents, and flagging of products for critical raw materials component extraction. A dataspace-based IT systems architecture is proposed for the implementation of the supply management system taking into account global and European information standards. Finally, key challenges to implement such an IT architecture are discussed.",

        "Abstract": "To boost data spaces and benefit from the great opportunities that they present, data sovereignty must be provided by Distributed Usage Control (DUC). Assuming that DUC will be managed by implementing and enforcing policies, notable efforts have already been undertaken in the context of Access Control (AC) regarding policy analysis due to the impact of low-quality policies on security. In this regard, this paper proposes that policy analysis in the DUC context should be understood as an extension of the AC, which is further affected by other challenging features, chief among which are context-aware control and extended control through action requirements. This paper presents a novel Context-Aware Policy Analysis (CAPA) algorithm for detecting inconsistencies and redundancies for DUC policies by supporting a large set of heterogeneous conditions. In this regard, the dependent relationship of conditions is formulated which will lead to more efficient conflict detection. By implementing this concept, a novel tree structure that combines a resource and a policy structure is presented to search for and compare relevant rules from policies. Built on the tree structure and through the formalization of rule conflicts, CAPA is developed and the security and performance it provides is tested in a wind energy use case.",

        "Abstract": "This paper proposes to combine the concept of digital twins with the concept of dataspaces to fulfill the original expectation that a digital twin is a comprehensive virtual representation of physical assets. Based upon a terminological and conceptual discussion of digital twins and dataspaces, this paper claims that a systemic approach towards digital twin Systems is required. The key conceptual approach consists of a Reference Model for Digital Twin Systems (DTS-RM) and a hypothesis regarding a symbiotic evolution. The DTS-RM distinguishes between a digital twin back-end platform comprising the access and management of comprehensive digital twin instances and digital twin-related services, and digital twin front-end services that are tailored to the demands of applications and users. The main purpose of the back-end platform is to decouple the digital twin’s generation and management from the usage of the digital twin for applications.",

Due to the complexity of the cultural heritage data and of their intrinsic inter-relationships, it is necessary to introduce a novel ontology, yet compliant with existing standards and interoperable with previous platforms used in this context as Europeana. The data space organization must be tailored to the methods and the theory of cultural heritage, briefly summarized in the introduction. The new ontology is based on the Digital Twin concept, i.e., the digital counterpart of cultural heritage assets incorporating all the digital information pertaining to them. This creates a Knowledge Base on the cultural heritage data space. The paper outlines the main features of the proposed Heritage Digital Twin ontology and provides some examples of its application. Future work will include completing the ontology in all its details and testing it in other real cases and with the various sectors of the cultural heritage community.",

This approach aims to extend the analytics services portfolio of various energy stakeholders and achieve two-way flows of electricity and information for optimized generation, distribution, and electricity consumption. The approach is based on semantic technologies to create knowledge-based systems that will aid machines in integrating and processing resources contextually and intelligently. Thus, a paradigm shift in the energy data value chain is proposed towards transparency and the responsible management of data and knowledge exchanged by the various stakeholders of an energy data space. The approach can contribute to innovative energy management and the adoption of new business models in future energy data spaces.",

        "Abstract": "Circularity is clearly a competitive advantage and a market opportunity for European industries. From this perspective, while digitalization is largely recognized as an accelerator and an enabler of Circular Economy, the fact that European industry is strong but fragmented (highly specialized medium- and small-sized companies have different needs and different tools) naturally results in the proliferation of commercial platforms for digitalized manufacturing. If such fragmentation is not properly addressed, it will eventually become a threat to European competitiveness. Despite some examples, value networks still do not operate in a seamless, transparent, and effective way. This paper addresses the challenges and the resulting technical funding pillars for an IDS (International Data Space) manufacturing platform meant to empower a fully digital circular thread of products and services.",

        "Abstract": "With the vision “Innovation by experiment” the Bauhaus.MobilityLab started in July 2020 as a living lab in the district Brühl of the city Erfurt, Thuringia, Germany. As a unique project, it is coupling the sectors mobility, logistics and energy into a unified living lab. It allows to design, develop and evaluate innovative services to increase the quality of life in the city. Bauhaus.MobilityLab offers access to live smart city data of different domains and provides a set of powerful artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for data processing, analytics and forecasting. In contrast to existing platforms, its uniqueness is the available and integrated living lab. It allows directly rolling out new smart city services and to evaluate the impact in the real world. This paper describes the implementation of the technical platform supporting the Bauhaus.MobilityLab, realized according to the DIN SPEC 91357 as an open urban platform. It focuses on data sharing based on the concepts of the International Data Spaces and the integration of AI algorithms. The concepts are presented based on examples in the energy domain.",

        "Abstract": "The concept of digital twins (DT) has already been discussed some decades ago. Digital representations of physical assets are key components in industrial applications as they are the basis for decision making. What is new is the conceptual approach to consider DT as well-defined software entities themselves that follow the whole lifecycle of their physical counterparts from the engineering, operation up to the discharge, and hence, have their own type description, identity, and lifecycle. This paper elaborates on this idea and argues the need for systematic DT engineering and management. After a conceptual description of DT, the paper proposes a DT lifecycle model and presents methodologies and tools for DT management, also in the context of Industrie 4.0 concepts, such as the asset administration shell (AAS), the international data spaces (IDS), and IEC standards (such as OPC UA and AML). As a tool example for the support of DT engineering and management, the Fraunhofer-advanced AAS tools for digital twins (FA3ST) are presented in more detail.",

        "Abstract": "The paper describes a reference architecture for open marketplaces to be used for networked stakeholders in industrial production ecosystems. The motivation for such an endeavor comes from the idea to apply the basic principle of the platform economy to offer functions of an asset “as a service” to industrial production, including the associated supply chain networks. Currently, commercial offers of “production as a service” usually lead to proprietary systems with the risk of platform vendor lock-ins. Hence, there is a need for an open approach that relies upon international (emerging) standards, especially those from IETF, IEC, the Plattform Industrie 4.0 and the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA). The presented approach enables federation of marketplaces according to well-defined interfaces. This article proposes a technology-independent open architecture derived from functional and non-functional system requirements and driven by the idea of the Smart Factory Web, a testbed of the Industrial Internet Consortium (IIC). Furthermore, the architecture of the Smart Factory Web (SFW) platform is presented and assessed against the current and future demands of open federated marketplaces for industrial production ecosystems.",

        "Abstract": "This manuscript discusses the key characteristics of the Digital Ecosystems (DEs) model, which, we argue, is particularly appropriate for connecting and orchestrating the many heterogeneous and autonomous online systems, infrastructures, and platforms that constitute the bedrock of a digitally transformed society. Big Data and AI systems have enabled the implementation of the Digital Twin paradigm (introduced first in the manufacturing sector) in all the sectors of society. DEs promise to be a flexible and operative framework that allow the development of local, national, and international Digital Twins. In particular, the “Digital Twins of the Earth” may generate the actionable intelligence that is necessary to address global change challenges, facilitate the European Green transition, and contribute to realizing the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda. The case of the Destination Earth initiative and system is discussed in the manuscript as an example to address the broader DE concepts. In respect to the more traditional data and information infrastructural philosophy, DE solutions present important advantages as to flexibility and viability. However, designing and implementing an effective collaborative DE is far more difficult than a traditional digital system. DEs require the definition and the governance of a metasystemic level, which is not necessary for a traditional information system. The manuscript discusses the principles, patterns, and architectural viewpoints characterizing a thriving DE supporting the generation and operation of “Digital Twins of the Earth”. The conclusions present a set of conditions, best practices, and base capabilities for building a knowledge framework, which makes use of the Digital Twin paradigm and the DE approach to support decision makers with the SDG agenda implementation.",

        "Abstract": "In recent years, a new business paradigm has emerged which revolves around effectively extracting value from data. In this scope, providing a secure ecosystem for data sharing that ensures data governance and traceability is of paramount importance as it holds the potential to create new applications and services. Protecting data goes beyond restricting who can access what resource (covered by identity and Access Control): it becomes necessary to control how data are treated once accessed, which is known as data Usage Control. Data Usage Control provides a common and trustful security framework to guarantee the compliance with data governance rules and responsible use of organizations’ data by third-party entities, easing and ensuring secure data sharing in ecosystems such as Smart Cities and Industry 4.0. In this article, we present an implementation of a previously published architecture for enabling access and Usage Control in data-sharing ecosystems among multiple organizations using the FIWARE European open source platform. Additionally, we validate this implementation through a real use case in the food industry. We conclude that the proposed model, implemented using FIWARE components, provides a flexible and powerful architecture to manage Usage Control in data-sharing ecosystems.",

        "Abstract": "The availability of timely, accessible and well documented data plays a central role in the process of digital transformation in our societies and businesses. Considering this, the European Commission has established an ambitious agenda that aims to leverage on the favourable technological and political context and build a society that is empowered by data-driven innovation. Within this context, geospatial data remains critically important for many businesses and public services. The process of establishing Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDIs) in response to the legal provisions of the European Union INSPIRE Directive has a long history. While INSPIRE focuses mainly on ’unlocking’ data from the public sector, there is need to address emerging technological trends, and consider the role of other actors such as the private sector and citizen science initiatives. The objective of this paper, given those bounding conditions is twofold. Firstly, we position SDI-related developments in Europe within the broader context of the current political and technological scenery. In doing so, we pay particular attention to relevant technological developments and emerging trends that we see as enablers for the evolution of European SDIs. Secondly, we propose a high level concept of a pan-European (geo)data space with a 10-year horizon in mind. We do this by considering today’s technology while trying to adopt an evolutionary approach with developments that are incremental to contemporary SDIs.",

        "Abstract": "European cities and communities (and beyond) require a structured overview and a set of tools as to achieve a sustainable transformation towards smarter cities/municipalities, thereby leveraging on the enormous potential of the emerging data driven economy. This paper presents the results of a recent study that was conducted with a number of German municipalities/cities. Based on the obtained and briefly presented recommendations emerging from the study, the authors propose the concept of an Urban Data Space (UDS), which facilitates an eco-system for data exchange and added value creation thereby utilizing the various types of data within a smart city/municipality. Looking at an Urban Data Space from within a German context and considering the current situation and developments in German municipalities, this paper proposes a reasonable classification of urban data that allows the relation of various data types to legal aspects, and to conduct solid considerations regarding technical implementation designs and decisions. Furthermore, the Urban Data Space is described/analyzed in detail, and relevant stakeholders are identified, as well as corresponding technical artifacts are introduced. The authors propose to setup Urban Data Spaces based on emerging standards from the area of ICT reference architectures for Smart Cities, such as DIN SPEC 91357 “Open Urban Platform” and EIP SCC. In the course of this, the paper walks the reader through the construction of a UDS based on the above-mentioned architectures and outlines all the goals, recommendations and potentials, which an Urban Data Space can reveal to a municipality/city. Finally, we aim at deriving the proposed concepts in a way that they have the potential to be part of the required set of tools towards the sustainable transformation of German and European cities in the direction of smarter urban environments, based on utilizing the hidden potential of digitalization and efficient interoperable data exchange.",

        "Abstract": "We are in front of a new digital revolution that will transform the way we understand and use services and infrastructures. One of the key factors of this revolution is related to the evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT). Connected sensors will be installed in cities and homes affecting the daily life of people and providing them new ways of performing their daily activities. However, this revolution will also affect business and industry bringing the IoT to the production processes in what is called Industry 4.0. Sensor-enabled manufacturing equipment will allow real time communication, smart diagnosis and autonomous decision making. In this scope, the Industrial Data Spaces (IDS) Association has created a Reference Architecture model that aims to provide a common frame for designing and deploying Industry IoT infrastructures. In this paper, we present an implementation of such Reference Architecture based on FIWARE open source software components (Generic Enablers). We validate the proposed architecture by deploying and testing it in a real industry use case that tries to improve the maintenance and operation of milling machines. We conclude that the FIWARE-based IDS implementation fits the requirements of the IDS Reference Architecture providing open source software suitable to any Industry 4.0 environment.",

However, creating frameworks and regulated realms for the sharing of data is very complex when multiple parties are involved and complicated regulation comes into play. As solution data spaces were introduced to enable participating parties to share data among themselves in an organized, regulated and standardized way. However, contract data processors, acting as data space participants, are currently unable to execute data requests on behalf of their contract partners. Here we show that an on-behalf-of actor model can be easily added to existing data spaces. We demonstrate how this extension can be realized using verifiable credentials. We provide a sample use case, a detailed sequence diagram and discuss necessary architectural adaptations and additions to established protocols. Using the extensions explained in this work numerous real life use cases which previously could technically not be realized can now be covered. This enables future data spaces to provide more dynamic and complex real world use cases.",

Additionally, the benefits of data-driven analysis are vast and have significantly propelled research in many fields. Data sharing benefits scientific advancement, as it promotes transparency, and collaboration, accelerates research and aids in making informed decisions. The European strategy for data aims to create a single data market that ensures Europe’s global competitiveness and data sovereignty. Common European Data Spaces ensure that data from different sources are available in the economy and society, while data providers (e.g., hospitals and scientists) control data access. The National Research Data Infrastructure for Personal Health Data (NFDI4Health) initiative is a prime example of an effort focused on data from clinical trials and public health studies. Collecting and analyzing this data is essential to developing novel therapies, comprehensive care approaches, and preventive measures in modern healthcare systems. This work describes distributed data analysis services and components that adhere to the FAIR data principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) within the data space environment. We focus on distributed analytics functionality in Gaia-X-based data spaces. Gaia-X offers a trustworthy federation of data infrastructure and service providers for European countries.",

Often, these intermediaries are trusted to filter the relayed data items, e.g., in order to support query-based data access APIs, or to implement access control. In this paper, we explore and compare two approaches for protecting data against illegitimate tampering, balancing the need for data filtering and data integrity protection. We apply our concept in data spaces that serialize data objects using JSON-LD, e.g., data spaces that implement ETSI's NGSI-LD API, and we enable intermediaries to hide segments of the transmitted data, providing at the same time integrity verification proofs for the revealed portions. Both approaches are efficient, with minimal communication and computational overhead.",

When multiple actors are involved, ensuring that data is accessible only to authorized parties and protecting it against theft present significant challenges. A potential solution to these issues is creating data spaces that interconnect clusters managed by different actors. The latter can securely exchange data under specific constraints and terminate connections when needed. This paper aims to show how infrastructure-level data spaces, which support both access to data, and processing of it, can facilitate secure data exchange and limit data theft. Furthermore, we investigate how data sovereignty can be maintained through cluster data exchange, which is crucial in an era where data is increasingly regulated and controlled. Additionally, we explore how offloading applications from the data consumer into the data producer cluster can match data gravity patterns, improving overall system efficiency. Finally, this paper presents the potential integration of the proposed solution within the framework of IDSA and Gaia-X, serving as promising option for implementing their proposed functionalities.",

Provenance data includes the state of a visualization within a tool as well as the user’s interactions performed while interacting with the tool. Research in this field has produced in many new approaches that generate data for specific tools and use cases. However, since a variety of tools are used and analytic tasks are performed in real analysis use cases there is a problem in building an interoperable baseline data corpus for investigation of the transferability of different approaches. In this paper, we present a visionary data space architecture for integrating and processing analytic provenance data in a unified way using semantic modeling.

Efficient use of materials and products over time is a critical aspect of CE, helping to reduce CO2 emissions, waste and resource consumption. The Digital Product Passport (DPP) is a CE-specific approach that contains information about components and their origin, and can also provide environmental and social impact assessments. However, creating a DPP requires collecting and analyzing data from many different stakeholders along the supply chain and even throughout the product lifecycle. In this paper, we present a concept for the SPACE_DS, which is a data space for circular economy data. A key point here is that the SPACE_DS enables the creation of DPPs by especially considering privacy and security concerns of data providers.",

The use of data spaces, where data is exchanged among members in a self-regulated environment, is becoming increasingly popular. However, the current manual practices of managing metadata and vocabularies in these spaces are time-consuming, prone to errors, and may not meet the needs of all stakeholders. By leveraging the power of machine learning, we believe that semantic interoperability in data spaces can be significantly improved. This involves automatically generating and updating metadata, which results in a more flexible vocabulary that can accommodate the diverse terminologies used by different sub-communities. Our vision for the future of data spaces addresses the limitations of conventional data exchange and makes data more accessible and valuable for all members of the community.",

On the one hand, current centralized approaches are plagued by issues such as lack of privacy and control for users, high costs, and bad performance, making these approaches unsuitable for the decentralized data spaces prevalent in Europe and various industries (decentralized on the conceptual and physical levels while centralized in the underlying implementation). On the other hand, decentralized systems face challenges with limited knowledge of/control over the global system, fair resource utilization, and data provenance. Our proposed Semantic Data Ledger (SDL) approach combines the advantages of both architectures to overcome their limitations.

We define the key security requirements for the operation of such platforms in untrusted environments and present an overall security architecture for the whole ecosystem including the secure design and implementation of an architecture for the participating cyber-physical devices.

        "Abstract": "Considering the dramatic impact of the current technology changes on user privacy, it is important to contemplate privacy early on in software development. Ensuring privacy is particularly challenging in industrial ecosystems, in which an enterprise may depend on or cooperate with other enterprises to provide an IT service to a service customer. An example for such ecosystems is the Industrial Data Space (IDS). The IDS provides a basis for creating and using smart IT services, while ensuring digital sovereignty of service customers. In this paper, motivated by Article 25 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (GDPR), we apply a model-based privacy analysis approach to the IDS to enable the verification of conformance to customer's privacy preferences. To this end we extend an existing model-based privacy analysis to support customer's privacy preferences in compliance with the Article 5 of the GDPR. We also provide a privacy check to support the privacy of data exchanges between the enterprises. The approach is supported by the CARiSMA tool.",

        "Abstract": "The incumbent minister of the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture announced at the beginning of his tenure that farmers need more appreciation and that prices should more strongly express the ecological truth. He does not further tolerate an exploitative system that comes at the expense of people, animals, the environment, and the climate, and pleads for more appreciation and value creation for farmers. One approach to address this issue is the provision of authenticated, traceable, and irreversible data about the food origin and production process. This paper presents the methods, experiences and results of a project that examined in cooperation with relevant stakeholders the technical possibilities of a data space that provides production and process data to the customer. An integral part of this data space is a blockchain module that ensures the traceability and irreversibility of the data. The paper contributes to research on blockchain application in governmental systems that provide trustful information in a food data space and it provides insights in to the concerns of different stakeholders as well as their role in the overall governance of a blockchain supported data space.",

        "Abstract": "With the advent and pervasiveness of the Internet of Things (IoT), big data and cloud computing technologies, digitalization in enterprises and factories has rapidly increased in the last few years. Digital platforms have emerged as an effective mechanism for enabling the management and sharing of data from various companies. To enable sharing of data beyond the platform boundaries, definition of new platform federation approaches is on the rise. This makes enabling the federation of digital platforms a key requirement for large-scale dataspaces. Therefore, the identification of platform federation requirements and building blocks for such dataspaces needs to be systematically addressed. In this paper, we try to systematically explore the high-level requirements for enabling a federation of digital platforms in the manufacturing domain and identify a set of building blocks. We integrate the requirements and building blocks into the notion of dataspaces. The identified requirements and building blocks act as a blueprint for designing and instantiating new dataspaces, thereby speeding up the development process and reducing costs. We present a case study to illustrate how the use of common building blocks can act as common guiding principles and result in more complete and interoperable implementations.",

        "Abstract": "In the context of Industry 4.0, the manufacturing related processes have shifted from conventional processes within one organization to collaborative processes cross different organizations, for example, product design processes, manufacturing processes, and maintenance processes across different factories and enterprises. The application of Internet of things, i.e. smart devices and sensors increases collection and availability of diverse data. Advanced technologies such as big data analytics and cloud computing offer new opportunities for effective optimization of manufacturing related processes, e.g. predictive maintenance. Predictive maintenance provides a detailed examination of the detection, location and diagnosis of faults in related machineries using various analyses. RAMI4.0 is a framework for thinking about the various efforts that constitute Industry 4.0. It spans the entire product life cycle & value stream axis, hierarchical structure axis and functional classification axis. The Industrial Data Space (now International Data Space) is a virtual data space using standards and common governance models to facilitate the secure exchange and easy linkage of data in business ecosystems. It thereby provides a basis for creating and using smart services and innovative business processes, while at the same time ensuring digital sovereignty of data owners. This paper looks at how to support predictive maintenance in the context of Industry 4.0? Especially, applying RAMI 4.0 architecture supports the predictive maintenance using FIWARE framework, which leads to deal with data exchanging among different organizations with different security requirements as well as modularizing of related functions.",

The EU expects through the exchange of interoperable health data (i) a better access for the European citizens to health services, (ii) increasing patients’ sovereignty and empowerment and (iii) a better service provision through the access to health data for research and innovation, policymaking, and regulatory decisions. To address this challenge, we present in this paper some further developments of our distributed and interoperable e-health framework ‎[47]‎ [23] ‎[42] ‎[34]. We extended the architecture with a streamlined and customized design thinking process to rapidly acquire software requirements and specifications. This paper is designed as a proof-of-concept around the Horizon 2020 research project ESCAPE. User requirements and specifications were gathered using the design thinking process and implemented in the flexible architecture. The result is a comprehensive and customized clinician dashboard which is embedded in the interoperable architecture as a customized clinical solution for care managers in an intervention of multimorbid patients.",

        "Abstract": "Modern data management is evolving from centralized integration-based solutions to a non-integration-based process of finding, accessing and processing data, as observed within dataspaces. Common reference dataspace architectures assume that sources publish their own domain-specific schema. These schemas, also known as semantic models, can only be partially created automatically and require oversight and refinement by human modellers. Non-expert users, such as mechanical engineers or municipal workers, often have difficulty building models because they are faced with multiple ontologies, classes, and relations, and existing tools are not designed for non-expert users. The PLASMA framework consists of a platform and auxiliary services that focus on providing non-expert users with an accessible way to create and edit semantic models, combining automation approaches and support systems such as a recommendation engine. It also provides data conversion from raw data to RDF. In this paper we highlight the main features, like the modeling interface and the data conversion engine. We discuss how PLASMA as a tool is suitable for building semantic models by non-expert users in the context of dataspaces and show some applications where PLASMA has already been used in data management projects.",

EVs are key infrastructure for achieving a sustainable energy future since EV usage can support in achieving CO2 reduction. However, the deployment of EVs for eMobility is highly dependent on data integration of mobility solutions from different stakeholders involved in urban transportation. Respectively, data integration from different mobility services will result to cost reduction and create valued added services to citizens. Therefore, there is need to achieve data integration not only for physical systems but for all domains in providing mobility related services that can be synergically applied to citizens and stakeholders in order to develop innovative solutions at district and urban level. Therefore, this study adopts Enterprise Architecture (EA) for digital transformations of eMobility services for sustainable transportation. Action research methodology was employed and secondary data from the literature was presented in the industrial data space reference architecture to initially validate digital transformation of electro mobility. Findings from this study reveal that EA support digital transformation of eMobility in managing data integration to support cities to implement sustainable transportation services.",

        "Abstract": "Manufacturing industries continuously face the challenge of delivering high-quality products under high production rates while minimizing non-value adding activities. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has caused manufacturers to rethink and reassess their global supply chains and the flexibility of their production sites. Resilience means the ability to withstand difficult situations without incurring significant extra costs. The deficiencies can be attributed largely to the lack of efficient ways for trusted data sharing among the value chain stakeholders without interoperability barriers. There is a need to be able to determine when such changes lead to deterministic-chaotic behavior with far reaching consequences. This work presents a framework to support production networks' reconfiguration for resilient manufacturing value chains. The proposed concept utilizes platform-based manufacturing that builds on the concept of dataspace and its reference implementations of Gaia-X and IDS for data-sharing in the horizontal supply chain and the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) for implementing intra-factory reconfiguration practices. Moreover, the proposed framework considers the Digital Twin of the value-adding network as a key enabling technology to achieve reconfiguration of production systems and networks. The concept has been projected upon an industrial case in order to validate its potential.",

        "Abstract": "Data sharing has facilitated the digitisation of society. We can access our bank accounts or make an appointment with our doctor anytime and anywhere. To achieve this, we have to share certain information, whether personal, professional, etc. This may seem like a minor cost for an individual user, but actually the data economy as the backbone of a digital transformation that is reshaping all aspects of human life. However, one of the major concerns arises regarding what happens to such individual data; once shared, control over it is often lost. For that reason, users and companies are reluctant to share their data. The European Union, through its European Strategy for Data, is establishing a policy and legal framework for establishing a single market for data in Europe by improving the trust and fairness of the data economy. Data spaces are a commitment to sharing data in a reliable and secure way, but this endeavour should, of course, not be at the expense of privacy rights. In recent years, Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) have emerged to achieve data sharing and privacy preservation that can address the requirements of data spaces around sensitive citizen and business data. In this work, we review existing PETs and assess their relevance, technological maturity, and applicability in the context of common European data spaces. Finally, we illustrate the benefits of secure data sharing via Federated Learning in a healthcare use case, where the preservation of privacy is a primer requirement and is therefore to be guaranteed.",

        "Abstract": "Industry 4.0 has become a reality by fusing the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), providing huge opportunities in the way manufacturing companies operate. However, the adoption of this paradigm shift, particularly in the field of smart factories and production, is still in its infancy, suffering from various issues, such as the lack of high-quality data, data with high-class imbalance, or poor diversity leading to inaccurate AI models. However, data is severely fragmented across different silos owned by several parties for a range of reasons, such as compliance and legal concerns, preventing discovery and insight-driven IIoT innovation. Notably, valuable and even vital information often remains unutilized as the rise and adoption of AI and IoT in parallel with the concerns and challenges associated with privacy and security. This adversely influences inter- and intra-organization collaborative use of IIoT data. To tackle these challenges, this article leverages emerging multi-party technologies, privacy-enhancing techniques (e.g., Federated Learning), and AI approaches to present a holistic, decentralized architecture to form a foundation and cradle for a cross-company collaboration platform and a federated data space to tackle the creeping fragmented data landscape. Moreover, to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed reference model, a collaborative predictive diagnostics and maintenance case study is mapped to an edge-enabled IIoT architecture. Experimental results show the potential advantages of using the proposed approach for multi-party applications accelerating sovereign data sharing through Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) principles.",

        "Abstract": "The digitalization of industrial processes together with the broad integration of IoT infrastructures across production systems, are drastically impacting manufacturing value chains and the business models built on the top of them. Starting from the idea of dematerializing production resources and of embracing servitization, this paper describes the architecture behind a platform in the Manufacturing as a Service (MaaS) domain, creating an ecosystem that acts as a virtual marketplace bringing un-exploited production capacity, as well as other virtual and physical assets, closer to the production demand, to obtain their optimal matching. The platform creates a direct connection among manufacturing services providers, the technologies they integrate, and the products/resources customers are looking for. As the measurement of the sustainability performances of products and companies is a relevant element in the service/product selection process, the platform supports the automated acquisition of manufacturing data, their elaboration through an LCA based engine and the aggregation into indicators. Such indicators are used to sort suppliers into the sustainability perspective and/or provide means of communication of impacts generated by manufacturing. As a data rich platform, it integrates the INTERNATIONAL DATA SPACES (IDS) connector to link different entities through secure exchange and trusted sharing of data, thus supporting data sovereignty. The integration of the IDS reference architecture forms the basis for data privacy and security offering trust between platform participants and guaranteeing for data creators, respect to who is using their data, for how long, for which application, how many times and according to which terms & conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Digital technologies nowadays play a major role in innovation within the agri-food domain. The evolution of IT systems has currently arrived at a level that involves complex systems integration and business ecosystems in which many stakeholders in different roles are involved. A new paradigm for digital innovation is needed that copes with this increased complexity.This paper presents an empirically informed framework for analysing and designing viable, sustainable digital innovation ecosystems in the agri-food domain. The research is based on a series of European large-scale public-private innovation projects from 2011 to 2021 with a total budget of 73 M€. They involved hundreds of stakeholders that were developing a large number of digital solutions through which a digital innovation ecosystem for agri-food was formed. In a longitudinal study, a conceptual framework was used to analyse these projects and describe how the digital innovation ecosystem has developed. Lessons learnt are translated into a number of design principles and an organizational approach to foster digital innovation ecosystems in agri-food. The conceptual framework consists of 6 key concepts: (i) innovation strategy, (ii) innovation organization, (iii) innovation network that contains (iv) the innovation process and (v) the innovation object and finally (vi) an innovation infrastructure. Along these 6 concepts, lessons learnt and in total 21 design principles are derived from analysing the projects forming a basis for the organizational framework. At the core of this framework is a lean multi-actor approach to trials and use case development interacting with a set of multidisciplinary activities: (i) developing a common technical collaboration infrastructure, (ii) identifying value streams with user engagement, (iii) engaging the right partners and stakeholders at the right time supported by strategic project planning and dynamic management. The most important conclusion is that effective, successful and quick use of appropriate IT in agri-food requires that actors should not be analysed in isolation from both their technological and business environment. Another consequence is that a ‘minimal viable ecosystem’ only emerges after considerable time, resources and ingenuity is invested and may require outside (government) intervention.",

Data spaces, a federated data management system, is gaining increasing attention in Europe and Japan. To promote data spaces into real applications and increase data exchange between companies and individuals, the data exchanged over data spaces must be well protected. To achieve that goal, we propose to apply homomorphic encryption scheme to data spaces, propose its architecture, and analyze its advantages. Furthermore, we also investigate the feasibility of the proposed architecture based on results of calculation of GHG emission of a self-driving electric vehicle in the real-world experiment.",

A key issue in this context is the respect of data sovereignty. The International Data Spaces (IDS) Reference Architecture has been developed in order to preserve data sovereignty. In this regard, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as sensors, play an important role for providing data. However, an IoT device is not capable of being integrated directly into the IDS by default. We propose an approach to enable the IDS for vendor independent IoT devices, using an open interoperability standard for the IoT specified by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). This allows data owners to benefit from providing their own data while retaining control over it.",

        "Abstract": "Digital Twins (DTs) are the novel paradigm for the development of Cyber-Physical systems. The state of art presents several use cases in different domains, and one of the most complex examples is represented by the Urban Digital Twin (UDT), which aims to virtualize urban assets (e.g., buildings, mobility infrastructures, energy grids, waste management facilities, etc.) and build advanced analysis and prediction services upon a city’s digital representation. UDTs represent a formidable example of system of systems, as they are structured into a hierarchy of interconnected DT instances that process and share a huge amount of data subject to different access and usage policies.Regarding data management in complex distributed scenarios, Data Spaces are an emerging paradigm that aims at building a secure and privacy-preserving infrastructure to pool, access, share, process and use data. As a matter of fact, existing DTs solutions (not only in the urban domain) do not present a clear software architecture characterization and, moreover, they pay little attention to the data management aspects.To bridge this gap, in this paper we present the Digital Twin Space, an architectural proposal that aims to instantiate Data Spaces into DTs according to the guidelines set by relevant international projects. We use the UDT as a running example and we validate the model in the case of a smartPV panel, showing that the model matches the real cyber-physical system.",

Static and dynamic information from industrial assets (presses and laser cutting machines) are modelled with new AAS submodels and the result is stored in an AAS manager/registration system. A manufacturing orchestrator discovers assets through the registry and completes production orders. The AAS registry allows the selection of assets with capabilities to perform tasks and also shares the AAS catalogue available in the system. The catalogue is shared with external parties through Data Space Connectors. Third party companies can launch manufacturing orders remotely using the same connectors. The paper validates the implementation of AAS components and IDS connectors in a manufacturing context where remote production orders can be securely activated.",

There is no support for creating AAS automatically to help integrate the two technologies in a convenient way. In addition, the authors do not share the AASs directly with the IDS connector, but an AAS catalogue assets, a list of all available AAS inside the AAS registry as defined in the AAS specification. This means that only the submodel level data are stored there, being no support for sharing the whole AAS. In the architecture, an additional orchestrator is used to find communication information of the asset in the catalogue to contact it directly for data elements and values through the orchestrator'."

Cross-domain resilience is achieved through data exchanges based on the International Data Space Association (IDSA) architecture, and the Edge Data-Centers are assumed to host critical applications for monitoring and control of both the telecommunications and power networks. In the context of Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled smart power grid, Energy Management Systems (EMSs) are deployed as distributed applications that rely on communication network programmability to achieve the quality-of service-objectives. The communication network programmability is performed as-a-service, by distributed SDN-Controllers (SDN-C) operated by the telecommunication operator. To ensure the high availability of these critical functions, we propose an IDSA-based centralized resilience orchestrator framework that ensures a dynamic service redundancy scheme to achieve failure tolerance and high availability of critical services in the SDN-enabled smart power grid.",

        "Abstract": "The maritime industry expects several improvements to efficiently manage the operation processes by introducing Industry 4.0 enabling technologies. Seaports are the most critical point in the maritime logistics chain because of its multimodal and complex nature. Consequently, coordinated communication among any seaport stakeholders is vital to improving their operations. Currently, Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Port Community Systems (PCS), as primary enablers of digital seaports, have demonstrated their limitations to interchange information on time, accurately, efficiently, and securely, causing high operation costs, low resource management, and low performance. For these reasons, this contribution presents the Seaport Data Space (SDS) based on the Industrial Data Space (IDS) reference architecture model to enable a secure data sharing space and promote an intelligent transport multimodal terminal. Each seaport stakeholders implements the IDS connector to take part in the SDS and share their data. On top of SDS, a Big Data architecture is integrated to manage the massive data shared in the SDS and extract useful information to improve the decision-making. The architecture has been evaluated by enabling a port authority and a container terminal to share its data with a shipping company. As a result, several Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) have been developed by using the Big Data architecture functionalities. The KPIs have been shown in a dashboard to allow easy interpretability of results for planning vessel operations. The SDS environment may improve the communication between stakeholders by reducing the transaction costs, enhancing the quality of information, and exhibiting effectiveness.",

Existing approaches ensuring sovereign data exchange in business ecosystems, like the International Data Spaces (IDS) initiative, neglect limitations of hardware resource restrictions. Therefore, we examine real-time sovereign data exchange in cloud-connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Two lightweight communication schemes based on request/response and publish/subscribe are proposed and implemented following the IDS guidelines. For evaluation, we use a simulated test-bed based on an Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) use case. We examine the results based on exchanged IDS messages and CPU usage on the consumer side represented by the AGVs as IoT devices. Results show benefits in the publish/subscribe version in longer operation times, allowing to enter low-power mode, while request/response performs better on limited CPU resources or short operations.",

It has an open architecture, based on a private cloud, which allows the integration of diverse data and provides different data processing capabilities and services necessary to build integral data spaces. The pilot implementation currently performs monitoring and analysis of the environmental factors in Sofia using a set of bespoke components, which implement data management and data analysis algorithms from simple filtering and correlation to data analytics and prediction using historical data, static modelled data and dynamic data from environmental sensors in real-time. It serves as a basis for data enrichment based on different sources and cross-domain analysis using a variety of methods. This new opportunity has a huge potential and will have a significant impact on urban life - from planning the infrastructure and managing the communal services to the personalization of social services for the citizens.",

        "Abstract": "Smart Factory Web is a platform for smart factories to enable flexible sharing and management of assets and resources to maximize efficiency and provide visibility on a global market. To join the Smart Factory Web, participants describe their factory capabilities, which are modelled in an ontology. AutomationML is used to assist with this modelling. OPC UA is used as a communication protocol for factory live-data from the machines. However, factory owners are hesitant to share critical production data. Therefore, the communication has to be secure and in the best case, provide control mechanisms for the data owners. The International Data Space is a peer-to-peer network that will support secure exchange of data and data usage control. In this paper, the Smart Factory Web approach is discussed and extended by an implementation with the current state of the International Data Space.",

On the one hand, the toolset supports consistent model-driven authoring of data specifications based on common semantic vocabularies, including their technical artifacts such as data schemas for CSV, XML and JSON, and standards-based ontology mappings to ensure interpretability of the data as RDF. Data producers then provide their data according to the specifications, in a format with which they are the most comfortable. On the other hand, Atlas enables the users to efficiently store and query the provided data using multi-model databases. It does so by exploiting the compliance of the provided data with the data specification for minimizing the manual effort needed to store the data in the data consumer's database, regardless of the data format chosen by the data producer.",

        "Abstract": "Data utilization for efficiency and optimization is increasing in many fields, and it is expected to create new value by sharing data among multiple stakeholders. In addition to domain-specific data platforms, which are already prevalent in Europe and Japan, cross-domain data platforms are being developed to enable interoperable and sovereign data exchange across different domains. However, through an extensive survey, we found that as the requirements for data exchange vary with regulations and/or applications, data platform initiatives and the software tools they offer are scattered. Thus, we need an experimental environment where various data exchange platform technologies can be learned, developed, and tested in one place. The objective of this paper is to propose the establishment of the International Testbed for Dataspace Technology (ITDT), an academic and industrial testbed for data platform technology. The ITDT intends to provide an environment that facilitates the development and testing of interoperability, portability, and customizability for data platform technologies. We expect the ITDT to promote the advancement of data platforms, international collaboration, and the formation of a neutral technical community. This paper presents the requirements, architectural design, and future plans for the ITDT.",

One aspect that needs to be tackled for the realization of envisioned open-edge Ecosystems, is the secure and trusted exchange of data services among diverse stakeholders. In this work, we present a novel approach for integrating mechanisms for trustworthy and sovereign data exchange, into Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) environments. To this end, we introduce an architecture that extends the ETSI MEC Architectural Framework with artifacts from the International Data Spaces Reference Architecture Model, accompanied by processes that automatically enrich Edge Computing applications with data space capabilities in an as-a-service paradigm. To validate our approach, we implement an open-source prototype solution and we conduct experiments that showcase its functionality and scalability. To our knowledge, this is one of the first concrete architectural specifications for enabling data space features in MEC systems.",

Data spaces are an emergent concept that helps to overcome some of the challenges related to data sharing and supports the creation of innovative solutions in a trustful and mutually beneficial manner. This paper shows how competing companies in the mobility domain can collaborate toward optimizing the performance of a traffic prediction algorithm through implementing federated machine learning in a data space. The proposed method avoids sensitive data sharing by executing machine learning algorithms within the private environments of competing companies while only the trained model instances are shared. The approach has various applications beyond the one presented in the paper.",

Such data is increasingly shared among various stakeholders to support advanced (predictive) analytics and precision decision making in different application domains like smart cities and industrial internet. Currently there are several platforms that facilitate sharing, buying and selling IoT data. However, these platforms do not support the establishment and monitoring of usage contracts for IoT data. In this paper weaddress this research issue by introducing a new extensible platform for enabling contract-aware IoT dataspace services, which supports data contract specification and IoT data flow monitoring based on established data contracts. We present a general architecture of contract monitoring services for IoT dataspaces and evaluate our platform through illustrative examples with real-world datasets and through performance analysis.",

To achieve data sovereignty, various approaches have been proposed which rely on cloud computing resources to provide users with the necessary functionality to exchange sovereign data. However, when users are located far away from the cloud, using cloud resources can cause delays and potential network bandwidth bottlenecks. To address such issues, we propose an architecture that relies on edge computing resources. In this architecture, the components that handle the transfer of sovereign data are placed on-premise, allowing users to exchange data without using the cloud. To evaluate our approach, we conduct various experiments in a real-world setting using a system that follows the proposed architecture and a baseline that relies on the cloud. The results show that the proposed approach provides significant benefits, such as a ~20% latency reduction and increased network bandwidth.",

Likewise, the capabilities of data storage, processing and analysis have increased. In order to unlock the potential for inception of smart, data-driven services and novel value creation chains, a means for trustful data exchange that ensures traceability as well as the data owner's privacy and sovereignty is particularly important in the industrial domain. However, widely accepted standardized solutions that fulfill these requirements are still missing. The Industrial Data Space initiative addresses this deficiency by the specification and implementation of a reference architecture model that supports reliable data exchange within a virtual data space. In this paper, we present an ontology-based information model that declaratively describes the static and dynamic properties of entities involved in interactions within the Industrial Data Space. We contribute a conceptual model that serves as a central, unifying contract for data exchange, and show how it can be applied in the context of an industrial scenario.",

The main objectives of the EU Health Data Space Framework are to make the health sector more efficient and to advance scientific research in telehealth. One major hurdle is the way to ensure that it is used for the common good, but in the opinion of health professionals, this requires proper consideration of trust, ethics, and safety. For example, e-prescription will be a useful tool, but there are open questions about reimbursing cross-border costs. The potential danger and risks are that the use of eHealth data will affect the general rights of patients, especially the right to privacy and confidentiality under the European Charter of Patients' Rights and the General Data Protection Regulation. We are faced with the fact that not all countries have a national contact point for cross-border healthcare and the Regulation on Electronic Identification, Authentication and Trust Services (eIDAS). This ensures secure access to health data where patients should see who has visited their data in the hospital system or other health platforms, and in addition, may deny access to third parties. It remains challenging to receive reports from several EU countries to the Ombudsman for patients who can make visible data only to themselves through ID-certified health portals, but despite this, the hospital does not have this data and continues to use all the data.",

However, because data in the IDS are transferred across domains, existing policy creation approaches for a single domain cannot be applied in the IDS. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a negotiation scheme to create usage policies in the IDS. In detail, we formulate usage policy negotiation as a combinatorial auction problem and adopt the Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism to incentivize potential data providers to truthfully negotiate usage policies. Both theoretical and simulation results show that our scheme maintains truthfulness on data providers and is cost-efficient.",

In Japan, data-driven society is one of the most important concept for the future society referred in Society 5.0, DFFT (Data Free Flow with Trust), and National Data Strategy of Japan. Several public and/or industrial domains have already established data ecosystem including data sharing platforms. However, there are many scenarios and applications which cannot be supported by the domain-specific data platforms. For example, disaster response, tourism, GHG (Greenhouse Gas) management such as the Scope 3 protocol, supply chain management support, and smart city are among them. So, we need a cross-domain data-exchange platform to support these applications. The objective of this paper is to propose 'DATA-EX (data exchange)', which is a platform which is under development and will be operated by Data Society Alliance (DSA), and works as an infrastructure for cross-domain data exchange consisting of open standard specifications and guidelines for data exchange and platform operation, software systems based on the standards, and governance rules for the operation of DATA-EX. This paper presents definition, objectives, basic strategies, and architecture of DATA-EX, and its current status and future plan.",

However, the potential of IoT applications in processing marine data for climate change research is yet to be fully explored. A major challenge is to comply with the diverse legislation governing marine data collection and processing across different nations. This may discourage application providers from targeting the marine domain. In addition, the existence of numerous marine data providers worldwide, each utilizing its own interfaces and data formats, might make it impractical to automate the acquisition of marine data at scale. To overcome these chal-lenges, we propose a system that integrates existing marine data providers and incorporates data sovereignty components. These components enable the efficient sharing of marine data while ensuring compliance with applicable legislation. To demonstrate the potential of this approach, we run IoT applications using datasets from different data providers, and we estimate the likely impacts of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions on marine ecosystems.",

        "Abstract": "Over the last decade, the importance of FAIR principles as a reference for data reusability and openness has increased constantly. Various tools for FAIR data assessment exist, including manual approaches like the FAIR Data Self-Assessment Tool (SAT) and automated tools as the FAIR Evaluation Services and Generic Automatic Tool (GAT). However, subjectivity in manual assessment and limited guidance in automated tools represent significant drawbacks. In such a context, in 2020, the European Commission introduced the “European Data Strategy” to create a unified data market, preserving European competitiveness and data sovereignty. Common European data spaces facilitate access to data in various sectors and promote convergence of data infrastructures and regulations, with a focus on interconnection and interoperability, complying to international standards, such as INSPIRE and FAIR principles, to achieve a unified EU data space. In this work, we propose a tool called CkanFAIR for the automatic assessment of dataset FAIRness in PA portals. The tool incorporates the European Data Quality Guidelines for a more comprehensive dataset evaluation and implements the euFAIR metrics. With this tool, we aim to improve the quality and sharing of data in a reliable environment that can pave the way to the creation of a data space fully compliant with FAIR principles, as well as conforming to community standards in PAs portals. From a wider perspective, it could also signify the initial phase in embracing FAIR Digital Twins (FDT). To validate our results, we compared CkanFAIR with corresponding SAT and GAT, highlighting significant differences.",

This paper addresses this challenge by utilizing the design thinking as a framework. However, although design thinking is a well-proven customer-centric tool, implementation for a large platform is difficult. To solve this, a workflow incorporated stakeholder mapping, customer journey mapping, and value proposition canvas is proposed ensuring a systematic empathy, insights extraction, and ideation for technical features.As a study case, the proposed method is experimented during the development of the Thailand Health Dataspace (THDS), a digital healthcare platform enabling an integration of third-party stakeholders to public health dataspace. 529 participants from different stakeholder groups were involved. The proposed method has successfully provided a set of technical features while captured the values which each stakeholder is expecting from THDS.",

        "Abstract": "The food supply chain plays a vital role in guaranteeing the availability of safe, nutritious, and adequate food for human consumption. However, the data transmission in the food supply chain currently faces challenges when combined with blockchain technology, including issues related to data sovereignty, cross-chain interaction, and concurrency performance within blockchain. To address these three challenges, this paper presents a novel architecture that optimizes the aforementioned issues. For the data sovereignty problem, we introduce the International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) approach. To address the cross-chain interaction problem, we employ various cross-chain technologies based on different scenarios, and analyze the advantages and disadvantages of each. The data block matrix is used to tackle the blockchain concurrency performance problem, and we provide an overview of its working mechanism. We evaluate the performance of the data block matrix and demonstrate that it greatly enhances the consensus efficiency of the blockchain.",

The demonstration is based on a motivation scenario focusing on exception management. The system outline and its components, interfaces, and enabling technologies are described and linked to the different layers of the architecture. This paper documents and illustrates the use of the system with detailed models and screenshots. Earlier work is extended using business rules to identify and quantify exceptions and potential disruptions. Specifically, it is shown how shipment data are enhanced with data from IoT sensors of smart returnable assets to provide situation-aware decision support based on data analytical methods. This demonstration provides scholars and practitioners, active in the fields of enterprise computing, insights into the concepts, models and engineering technologies used to implement an architecture for situation-aware logistics. The instantiated architecture provides a rich testbed for experiments, measurements, and incorporate the ideas promoted by the international data space initiative. An online recording is available to support the demonstration and ignite discussion about the potential of IoT technologies and future research directions in pursuit of the smart logistics vision.",

        "Abstract": "A range of new kind of applications are growing for the integration of different technologies and needs such as IoT/IoE (Internet of Things/Everything), WoT (web of things), Digital twins and smart data models, data spaces. These applications demand less attention to the storage modeling since the adopted big data stores are less structured. Therefore, the connection from data storage to visual representation can be more automated. All these aspects open the path for rapid prototyping. In this paper a fast-prototyping development lifecycle for that category of smart applications is proposed. The proposed solution works on heterogeneous data types, push and pull, wide interoperability, covering all aspects from data ingestion to front-end. It can be regarded as a specific declination of AGILE development paradigm in which several activities have been strongly shortened by exploiting a number of modelling facilities of the development environment and technologies. The proposed development lifecycle was defined and tuned for the Snap4City platform, which provides an integrated development environment for rapid prototyping of smart application based on low coding, including visual programming, and a number of visual tools for creating the applications. The solution has been validated in the context of multiple interconnected scenarios of several large-scale projects and pilots such as Herit-Data, Panacea, Resolute, Replicate, TRAFAIR, etc.",

Manufacturing is also one of the key verticals defined by the 5G Infrastructure Public Private Partnership (5G PPP) aimed at digital transformation in industrial communication. In this paper, we will present the current status of the VTT’s (VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland Ltd) Industry X Smart Manufacturing Testbed, which enables Finnish industrial companies to test and experiment new production methods and technologies in an industrial-like environment. The testbed utilizes technologies varying from robotics to 5G and beyond connectivity, and from international data spaces (IDS) to extended forms of reality (AR, VR, MR) and digital twins. The testbed is built in a hierarchical manner. Inter-connected factory level testbeds comprise of factory process level processes that are grouped into use case families. These processes include several proofs of concept demonstrators, which utilize different technologies available in the testbed. In this paper, three recent proof-of-cencepts (PoC) are briefly presented to illustrate the next-generation manufacturing possibilities using the latest communication technologies available.",

        "Abstract": "Smart digital products and the resulting ecosystems are already enabling companies to create disruptive new digital business models today and will do so even more so in the future. Digital twins are one of the key technologies in the realization of such business models. In most cases, digital twins are already created in the early product development/engineering phases and continue to develop over the lifetime of the product. Particularly in engineering, there is already an intensive exchange of different parts of the digital twin within and across company boundaries (for example, between component manufacturers and system providers all the way to the customer/operator). This usually leads to different IT ecosystems for different stakeholders and industries. Standardized exchange of data is therefore essential to ensure a secure, trustworthy and efficient exchange of data within the enterprise IT and the value chain. This is where the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) comes to play. Using the example of a data management system, this contribution illustrates the various applications inside and outside the enterprise engineering IT of the Asset Administration Shell (e.g. import and export of Assets via Gaia-X-compliant data spaces or also just file-based) and discusses the respective use cases in more detail using concrete examples from projects funded by the BMBF, BMWK, EIT Manufacturing and the EU. The implementation of the use cases will be shown based on the engineering data management platform technology from CONTACT Software.",

        "Abstract": "The manufacturing industry is increasingly focused on sustainability, requiring greater product transparency to meet sustainability targets. Digital Product Passports (DPPs) have emerged as a potential solution to improve recyclability and inform consumer purchasing decisions. However, there is a lack of methodology and digital representation for building DPPs, which hinders data linkage and sharing. In this paper, we propose an approach based on standardised data models and event sourcing to aggregate production data, using energy consumption as an example. We present a concept that captures and stores process information using event sourcing in Asset Administration Shells (AAS), and evaluate its feasibility through a manufacturing demonstrator. The results show that event-based aggregation facilitates the creation of DPPs, allowing different actors in the value chain to participate in an interoperable way. By leveraging a standardised and interoperable common data space, this approach improves product transparency, promotes recyclability and enables informed consumer choice in line with sustainability goals.",

        "Abstract": "German cancer registries offer a systematic approach for the collection, storage, and management of data on patients with cancer and related diseases. Much hope in research and healthcare in general is depending on such register-based analyses in order to comprehensively consider the features of a highly diverse population. Next to the data collection the cancer registries are responsible for data protection. To fulfill legal regulations, access to data has to be controlled in a strict way leading to sometimes bureaucratic and slow processes. The situation is especially complicated in Germany, since cancer data is distributed over numerous federal cancer registries. If a nationwide data evaluation is conducted a research team has to negotiate a separate contract with each cancer registry.In a joint work in progress effort of cancer registries, technical, medical, and economical experts we propose a different solution for cooperative data processing. Our approach aims for combining data in a virtual pool based on the selection criteria of individual requests from researchers. To achieve our goal, we adapt the Fraunhofer Medical Data Space as enabling technology. The architecture we propose will allow us to pool data of multiple partners regulated by data access policies. In doing so, each of the data sources can introduce its own rules and specifications on how data is used. Additionally, we add a digital consent management that will allow individual patients to decide how their data is used. Finally, we show the high potential of the cooperative analysis of distributed cancer data supported by the proposed solution in our approach.",

        "Abstract": "Globally, manufacturing ecosystems are facing the challenge of twin transition, i.e., how to utilize digitalization for improving or transforming the sustainability of manufacturing operations. Here, operations refer widely to the upstream of manufacturing, while the entire product lifecycle also covers the downstream and end-of-life operations. Here, sustainability is understood to consider the impact of the product lifecycle at environmental, social, and governance (ESG) levels. In this article, we explore this progress through the digitalization concept of business-to-business data sharing, and through one example of a manufacturing ecosystem in Finland. We discuss the federated data space concept and the international data spaces (IDS) architecture as technological building blocks of twin transition, and report the first results from an industry−research shared-risk project. Semi-structured interviews and a diary-style reporting from an industry−research IDS proof-of-concept (PoC) experiment are presented and analyzed within a design science research method framework. The findings give the first indications that while data sharing is seen as important and increasing in relevance in industry, it is currently challenging for companies to see how an open standard architecture creates value beyond a single limited ecosystem view. We also highlight possible avenues for further research.",

        "Abstract": "Data sovereignty, the possibility to keep control over data, is gaining increasing attention in both research and industry. Due to complex supply chains and a strong trend toward digitization, digital assets are essential to be fast and competitive. As a result, companies need to share data while retaining control over it to prevent unwanted leaks of sensitive data. However, implementing effective data governance, access, and usage control mechanisms can be challenging, especially in cross-company data sharing networks and ecosystems like dataspaces. In this paper, we examine the industrial landscape and interview eleven experts from software providers and producing organizations to identify their requirements and challenges of existing data sovereign solutions. Based on Grounded Theory and semi-structured interviews, we explore the motivations and issues behind data sharing from an Information Systems and Software Engineering point of view. The findings include current industrial contexts, use cases, and solutions with data sovereignty’s technical and non-technical implementations. Seven requirements and thirteen challenges were observed throughout a qualitative analysis. Clustered by organizational, technical, personal, and emotional viewpoints, they are discussed with initial approaches for mitigation. The results identify current practical needs and will enable the design of future data sovereignty solutions in theory and different practical domains.",

It further defines procedures for the secondary use of electronic health data for research and development. Although this planned legislation is undoubtedly a step in the right direction, implementation approaches could potentially result in centralised data silos that pose data privacy and security risks for individuals. To address this concern, we propose federated personal health data spaces, a novel architecture for storing, managing, and sharing personal electronic health records that puts citizens at the centre—both conceptually and technologically. The proposed architecture puts citizens in control by storing personal health data on a combination of personal devices rather than in centralised data silos. We describe how this federated architecture fits within the EHDS and can enable the same features as centralised systems while protecting the privacy of citizens. We further argue that increased privacy and control do not contradict the use of electronic health data for research and development. Instead, data sovereignty and transparency encourage active participation in studies and data sharing.

In this way, the EHDS will support healthcare delivery (known as the “primary use of data”) and facilitate access to health data for research and policy-making purposes (known as the “secondary use of data”). To achieve this goal, we need to build the required ecosystem of the EHDS with all healthcare stakeholders. We conducted a survey research study to explore the health informaticians’ recommendations on future health data scenarios shaping the EHDS ecosystem. We created an anonymous- online questionnaire and disseminated it through wide international networks of health informaticians. In addition, we conducted a workshop during the Medical Informatics Europe Conference (MIE2022) and invited the attendees to complete the questionnaire during the workshop.",

As an implementation of these standards, data space technologies are of central importance for ensuring secure and sovereign processes and thus establishing trust between data space participants. In this paper, we present our approach, an IDS Connector reference implementation, to integrate data sharing and processing systems into data spaces by providing identity and data management, secure communication protocols, easy-to-use digital contract administration, and prototypical data usage control enforcement. After presenting the software architecture and design, we outline the successful application in selected use cases and derive lessons learned for further developments of data space technologies.",

Based on the existing reference model of the IDS, new types of user interfaces (UI) will be created for this purpose. It is important for the developers of the UI’s that the users and the associated core tasks are known, so that the interactions can be designed in a user-friendly interface. IDP’s are intended to support developers in developing applications. The patterns are design patterns and represent proven solutions for frequently occurring problems for the developers when designing the UI. They also provide design alternatives and can effectively support communication between potential end users and developers.",

        "Abstract": "The concept of Digital Twins offers the possibility of moving work from a physical environment to a virtual or digital environment and the ability to predict asset conditions in the future, or when it is physically undesirable, by exploiting the digital model. This in turn leads to significant reductions in the resources required to design, produce and maintain assets and resources. In the field of energy management, DTs are also starting to be considered as valuable analysis tools, as a digital twin facilitates real-time synchronisation between a real-world model (physical model) and its virtual copy for improved energy monitoring, prediction, and efficiency enhancement; thus, it can significantly reduce the overall energy consumption. A typical problem of DTs is the management of the data to be fed from the physical twin to the DT (and possibly the other way around), as one has to decide whether to store them within the DT or not, and one also has to decide whether to use different (depending on the data sources) or unified data governance models. To this end, an energy data space is proposed to allow the management of the necessary data in a way that is more functional to the DT concept.",

Requirements have been considered to build a reliable, trusted, anonymised environment within which involved stakeholders can safely share information on the indicators while keeping sovereignty over their data. Technologies such as enhanced Context Brokers, the usage of Industrial Data Spaces agents and the introduction of distributed publish-subscribe data exchange schemes lay the foundations of the proposed solution. This work entails the design of the system altogether with a proposal of technologies for its deployment. Drawing from previous public-funded projects’ results and highly relying on open-source technologies, the authors have come up with a solution that aims to be proven in real environments in the near future.",

        "Abstract": "The International Data Spaces Association (IDSA) has promoted the idea of International Data Spaces as a place for companies to share data with trust and security enforced by software and organizational competence. There has been considerable progress in delivering corporate guidelines, technical specifications, and software components available for testing and deploying applications to support IDS-based ecosystems, such as the IDS data connectors classified by the Fraunhofer Institute. However, full implementation of IDS applications seems still complex and expensive for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). A possible strategy to deal with such an issue is to break the IDSA specification’s complexity into smaller pieces and build small IDS ecosystems formed by its core business roles (e.g., data owners, users, and broker service providers). In this context, this paper addresses the problem of designing an application to support the broker service provider’s role in operating in an IDS-based ecosystem. This research, therefore, follows a Design Science approach in a three-step process. First, it investigates problems of practical relevance elicited from the IDSA guidelines in combination with requirements provided by representatives of the Dutch Logistics sector. Second, it gives design to tackle the problem by combining Semantic Web, Linked Data, and Enterprise Architecture modeling artifacts. Last, it validates the architecture of the broker service provider’s application by demonstrating its technical feasibility, innovation, and software integration.",

        "Abstract": "It is of utmost importance to maintain digital sovereignty in the context of Industry 4.0 and data-driven business models. As data itself becomes a valuable asset, this is a challenge that many companies have to face. This is particularly true as data sharing with third parties is a mandatory component of many modern business models. For its participants, the International Data Spaces (IDS) provide an ecosystem that supports the establishment and protection of their digital sovereignty. In this extended paper, we present the requirements in the area of usage control that have emerged from the IDS. We recapitulate the current state of the domain-specific language D, which has usage control mechanisms as a core functionality. We then introduce extensions to the policy system of D and the language itself to meet these requirements. We demonstrate how the policy system can be extended by label-based mechanisms in order to increase the expressiveness of the policy system. These mechanisms can be used to attach metadata to data as well as other language components of D and therefore allow easy tracing of data and sharing of information between language components such as policies. We introduce a mechanism to D that allows to dynamically map external identifiers (like the ones used in the IDS) to those used in D. This allows D to be combined with other usage control solutions as it facilitates the use of global identities that exceed D.",

It aims at providing a basis for smart services and cross-company business processes, while at the same time guaranteeing data owners’ sovereignty over their content. The IDS Information Model is an RDFS/OWL ontology defining the fundamental concepts for describing actors in a data space, their interactions, the resources exchanged by them, and data usage restrictions. After introducing the conceptual model and design of the ontology, we explain its implementation on top of standard ontologies as well as the process for its continuous evolution and quality assurance involving a community driven by industry and research organisations. We demonstrate tools that support generation, validation, and usage of instances of the ontology with the focus on data control and protection in a federated ecosystem.",

This challenges the traditional business driven IT strategy promoted by several Enterprise Architecture methodologies, which are designed to operate within a single enterprise that has a complete overview of its data and ICT systems. We envisage scenarios where public and private collaborative networks provide value added services to its citizens by leveraging on data. In this paper, we propose an Enterprise Architecture Framework for Cities to support them maneuvre smartly within their data space to create value added services through a variety of collaborative networks or Virtual Enterprises that bridge organisational boundaries. The novel elements of this Enterprise Architecture Framework are a DataxChange, the Value-Added Services and Virtual Enterprise layers.

        "Abstract": "Using data from different data sources is a common procedure in data-driven research. As required data is often not available from centrally managed sources, the concept of data spaces has more and more frequently been utilized to integrate decentral data sources and supporting the access to these. However, decentrally organized data management leads to differences in data models, formats and technologies and the problem of matching data from different sources most often still requires significant manual work, either from the provider or the consumer of the data. Especially in research data spaces, properties of data sources are often dynamically modified or extended, and complex queries are formulated to access the data. In this paper, we present an architecture to approach this problem by automatically exploring the different data sources and searching for similar attributes. Matching attributes are then assembled to so-called vocabularies, that represent common concepts in the data space independently from their actual representations. This dynamic knowledge base is then used to efficiently query and access data in the data space. Finally, an application of the concept is presented to demonstrate the applicability of our architectural framework.",

        "Abstract": "The future data-driven manufacturing ecosystems build upon data spaces where each participant controls how its own data are utilized. This goal is equally important in machinery where the networks comprise machine fleets and the data use cases range from local edge to various cloud systems and digital business integrations. These systems of systems require efficient, scalable data streaming with decoupled (e.g., publish-subscribe) platforms that enable the flexible connection of data producers and consumers in heterogeneous networks. This paper describes a work in progress about data autonomy, sovereignty, and trust in message brokers in machinery, aiming to contribute to initiatives, such as Gaia-X and International Data Spaces (IDS). First, the paper identifies requirements for platforms and communication that span edge and cloud. Second, it presents a technology survey about data autonomy in open, Internet-cabable brokers. These include Advanced Message Queueing Protocol (AMQP), MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT), Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar. It appears that there is little research about data autonomy in brokers and MQTT has the strongest base. The work continues to develop data autonomy into a message broker.",

With the ability to integrate and analyze data in real-time, multimodal knowledge graphs offer a wealth of insights for smart city applications, such as monitoring traffic flow, air quality, public safety, and identifying potential hazards. Knowledge enrichment can enable a more comprehensive representation of multimodal data and intuitive decision-making with improved expressiveness and generalizability. However, challenges remain in effectively modelling the complex relationships between and within different types of modalities in data spaces and infusing common sense knowledge from external sources. This paper reviews the related literature and identifies major challenges and key requirements for effectively developing multimodal knowledge graphs for data spaces, and proposes an ontology for their construction.",

        "Abstract": "From centralised platforms to decentralised ecosystems, like Data Spaces, sharing data has become a paramount challenge. For this reason, the definition of data usage policies has become crucial in these domains, highlighting the necessity of effective policy enforcement mechanisms. The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) is a W3C standard ontology designed to describe data usage policies, however, it lacks built-in enforcement capabilities, limiting its practical application. This paper introduces the Open Digital Rights Enforcement (ODRE) framework, whose goal is to provide ODRL with enforcement capabilities. The ODRE framework proposes a novel approach to express ODRL policies that integrates the descriptive ontology terms of ODRL with other languages that allow behaviour specification, such as dynamic data handling or function evaluation. The framework includes an enforcement algorithm for ODRL policies and two open-source implementations in Python and Java. The ODRE framework is also designed to support future extensions of ODRL to specific domain scenarios. In addition, current limitations of ODRE, ODRL, and current challenges are reported. Finally, to demonstrate the enforcement capabilities of the implementations, their performance, and their extensibility features, several experiments have been carried out with positive results.",

        "Abstract": "Utilizing data is crucial for economic success, but a lack of interoperability and concerns about the misuse of ones own data are hindering the cross-organizational use of data. Dataspaces provide the infrastructure necessary to integrate heterogeneous data sources within an organization or ecosystem, enabling seamless data interaction and interoperability. In addition, data spaces strengthen data sovereignty through their decentralized nature, which enables organizations to effectively control and manage their data. However, challenges persist in managing the complexity and dynamic nature of dataspaces, requiring significant resources and technical expertise. The decentralized nature leads to a large and diverse number of stakeholders, who need to agree on the use and scope of a dataspace. Modeling is a common approach to cope with technical complexity and heterogeneous stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a version of SysML and a corresponding method that focus on the modelling of data spaces. We provide a dataspace modelling method to unify the understanding of dataspaces and scope among all stakeholders to simplify the design and development process.",

        "Abstract": "The FAIR principles are globally accepted guidelines for improved data management practices with the potential to align data spaces on a global scale. In practice, this is only marginally achieved through the different ways in which organizations interpret and implement these principles. The concept of FAIR Digital Objects provides a way to realize a domain-independent abstraction layer that could solve this problem, but its specifications are currently diverse, contradictory, and restricted to semantic models. In this work, we introduce a rigorously formalized data model with a set of assertions using formal expressions to provide a common baseline for the implementation of FAIR Digital Objects. The model defines how these objects enable machine-actionable decisions based on the principles of abstraction, encapsulation, and entity relationship to fulfill FAIR criteria for the digital resources they represent. We provide implementation examples in the context of two use cases and explain how our model can facilitate the (re)use of data across domains. We also compare how our model assertions are met by FAIR Digital Objects as they have been described in other projects. Finally, we discuss our results’ adoption criteria, limitations, and perspectives in the big data context. Overall, our work represents an important milestone for various communities working towards globally aligned data spaces through FAIRification.",

        "Abstract": "The confluence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Dataspaces presents a captivating prospect for the future of data science and AI, fostering new avenues for data exploration, analysis, and knowledge extraction. This paper explores both patterns arising from the Dataspaces-LLMs convergence: Dataspaces applied to LLMs (DS4LLM) and LLMs applied to Dataspaces (LLM4DS), further investigating the latter. Dataspaces, a conceptual framework for data-centric systems, are poised to revolutionize data management and sharing, indeed. They provide a structured and secure environment for managing and integrating data from multiple sources. Traditional approaches to data management, nevertheless, are bottom-up, often hindering the timely use of data. This paper advocates for a top-down perspective, prioritizing data collection and provisioning to other data management tasks that have to be thus delivered on purpose and in a timely manner a-posteriori, after data (re)source discovery. To bridge the gap between these two approaches, LLMs emerge as a powerful tool able to unlock the value hidden within vast data repositories and Dataspaces. By LLMs, data management tasks such as filtering, cleaning, aggregation, integration, and augmentation can be automated into LLM4DS workflows. This research specifies some LLM4DS prompt templates that can be tailored to specific use cases for on demand and on purpose (a-posteriori) data management requiring post-scheme. A case study on a medical Dataspace demonstrates the practical application and suitability of the proposed LLM4DS approach to the problem at hand.",

        "Abstract": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained significant attention from many researchers as an effective solution to address the hallucination issue of Foundational Models (FMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs). Although the RAG framework is considered a successful approach for enhancing LLMs by providing a suitable retrieval mechanism to obtain appropriate external knowledge, it still has limitations in acquiring high-quality knowledge from diverse data sources. The complementary integration of RAG and data spaces is proposed to exploit RAG’s capabilities within data spaces. Data spaces provide RAG with the ability to obtain diverse and high quality data sources from several data providers under secure data-sharing mechanisms and direct data exchange negotiations. At the same time, RAG enhances the support services of data spaces. In this paper, we present a high-level architecture for RAG data space models (RAG-DSMs) with a unified lifecycle for RAG and data spaces, highlight the possible challenges of the proposed integration while presenting potential opportunities. Moreover, we present two use cases for leveraging RAG-DSMs in the mobility and health domains.",

To ensure patients' data privacy, healthcare organizations can incorporate pseudonymization strategies into their data management practices, promoting collaboration and information sharing among several hospital departments and healthcare professionals. In this paper, we defined and implemented the intent-based mul-tilevel granular approach for HL7 FHIR JSON documents pseudonymization, by comparing it with non-granular encryption of the entire document. With this approach, we enhance patient confidentiality and facilitate efficient healthcare data sharing within the Intra-Hospital Data Space, facilitating enhanced flexibility and scalability in deploying and utilizing data management systems.",

        "Abstract": "Data Spaces are ecosystems designed to allow multiple organizations or companies to share data in a secure manner. Despite the potential of these technologies, they encounter a number of challenges and privacy issues that limit their use. Privacy Preserving Enablers are mechanisms developed to tackle these difficulties, ensuring data integrity and access control. This paper aims to analyze the role of some Privacy Preserving Enablers and its integration with Connectors in the context of Data Spaces. The research will focus on key enablers, including a Self-Sovereign Identity with Zero-Knowledge Proof, which is a privacy preserving approach that allows users to verify their identity and attributes without the need to disclose underlying data, ensuring their privacy. Additionally, the usage of Sticky Policies instantiated through Attribute-Based Encryption attaches control policies into the encrypted data in order to have an attribute-based access control, enhancing its security. The application of Policies Enforcement assure the consistent application of policies and the maintenance of the security within the Data Space.",

However, failure to properly protect data may affect data subjects negatively, and damage the reputation of service providers. This work aims to establish a privacy-friendly data space that enables safeguarded sharing of health data1 among various stakeholders in health domains. We propose a comprehensive reference architecture that integrates security/privacy mechanisms to uphold security and privacy requirements of health data and ensure strict adherence to demanding mandates. Furthermore, this article puts forth a blueprint for contracts when sharing data to cultivate transparency among various parties by harmonizing legal, technical and operational facets. This blueprint significantly reduces uncertainties and fosters an environment of trust. Our twofold methodology enables entities of a health data space to share health data, while upholding the security and privacy principles. The Eclipse Data Space Connector (EDC) is used as the basis to implement the proposed architecture.",

        "Abstract": "Data spaces consist of trusted frameworks that manage the entire data lifecycle, encompassing various data models, metadata descriptors, ontologies for semantic interpretation, and data services for accessing, processing, and analyzing data. Domain-specific data spaces are currently being designed and deployed in vertical sectors, following specifications and reference frameworks that enable interoperability and compatibility. One such vertical sector with high impact on economy is mobility. In this paper, we present our position towards mobility data spaces, highlighting the idiosyncrasy of mobility data, while presenting the MobiSpaces approach that encompasses services for mobility data management and advanced mobility analytics. By exploiting MobiSpaces, mobility data providers can break the barrier of participation in data spaces thereby sharing their dataset with less hurdle, whereas data consumers can find advanced data analysis tools readily applicable on mobility data sets to extract insights and discover mobility patterns.",

This data-centric approach has also increased the need for effective metadata management that enables entities participating in data sharing scenarios to find and trust available data. In this paper, a metadata broker for manufacturing related Data Spaces is introduced. It is based on an ontology that has been implemented to describe data related to Industries 4.0 and 5.0 implementations. The proposed broker is based on Data Spaces principles and artefacts that it extends by enabling semantic-based modeling and search capabilities.",

        "Abstract": "In an increasingly connected digital world, the strategic use of data is critical to improving predictive accuracy, optimizing processes, and driving innovative business models. Data spaces can facilitate sovereign and secure data sharing across multiple organizations. A challenge in this environment is the lack of trust among data space participants, calling for independent data trustees. However, finding and selecting an appropriate data trustee can be difficult and is usually a manual process. Our research addresses this challenge by introducing a whitelisting approach for automatically selecting appropriate data trustees within a data space. We report on the results of an ongoing design science research project and describe the development of extensions to the Eclipse Dataspace Components, which enable the application of the whitelisting approach. These extensions are designed to support secure, efficient, and trusted data sharing. Our findings can support practitioners in the data space community in implementing robust mechanisms for selecting data trustees, thereby improving the functionality and trustworthiness of data spaces.",

Data spaces are distributed data collaboration infrastructure systems that enable data collaboration among stakeholders. One of the requirements for data space systems is the technical enforcement of governance policies for the shared data. The objective of this study is to propose a new policy definition language, DSPOL, as a stepping stone toward realizing the enforcement of data governance for the practical use of data spaces. DSPOL can describe the constraints that must be followed in data space systems when accessing and using data, and when distributing deliverables. It has verification and validation functions to ensure that the policy description is as the writer intended and that there are no inconsistencies in the policy. We defined the state transitions of data usage in data user environments, developed a model of the execution infrastructure in data space systems, and formulated the contents of the describable policies. We implemented DSPOL and its verification and validation functions. Examples of policy descriptions based on supposed scenarios were shown, and examples of verification and validation were presented.",

        "Abstract": "The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and big data has catalyzed the emergence of data markets. Regulatory and technological frameworks such as International Data Spaces (IDS) have been developed to facilitate secure data exchange while integrating security and data sovereignty aspects required by laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and NIS2. Recently, novel attack vectors have taken a toll on many enterprises, causing significant damage despite the deployed security mechanisms. Hence, it is reasonable to assume that the IDS may be just as susceptible. In this paper, we conduct a STRIDE threat analysis on IDS to assess its susceptibility to traditional and emerging cybersecurity threats. Specifically, we evaluate novel threats such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, compromised end-user devices, SIM swapping, and potential backdoors in commonly used open-source software. Our analysis identifies multiple vulnerabilities, particularly at the trust boundary (TB) between users and the IDS system. These include the traditionally troublesome Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, key management weaknesses, and the mentioned novel threats. We discuss the hacking techniques, tools, and associated risks to the IDS framework, followed by targeted mitigation strategies and recommendations. This paper provides a framework for performing a STRIDE-based threat analysis of the IDS. Using the proposed methodology, we identified the most potent threats and suggested solutions, thus contributing to the development of a safer and more resilient data space architecture.",

However, the practical application of FL in healthcare faces challenges due to complex privacy regulations and the lack of inherent robust governance mechanisms to ensure compliance and protect data ownership. To address these limitations, we propose a governed FL framework that leverages the Eclipse Dataspace Components (EDC) connector to enforce compliance and data sovereignty through the implementation of data access and usage policies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by training an in-hospital mortality prediction model and an Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) detection model using FL with Federated Averaging (FedAvg) and Secure Aggregation (SecAgg). Our results demonstrate that the governed FL framework enables the training of models with performance comparable to those trained on centrally aggregated data. At the same time, it effectively introduces governance through policy enforcement, making it a practical and compliant solution for healthcare applications.",

        "Abstract": "A core technology in realizing Industry 4.0 is the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) as an implementation of the Digital Twin. The AAS enables interoperable data-sharing in a company as well as within a network of companies, creating an AAS dataspace. To create this AAS dataspace, however, data in Systems of Record (SOR) such as ERP, PLM, and quality databases must be available as AASs. SORs typically form data silos that lack interoperability due to custom data models and interfaces that are typically incompatible with the native Industry 4.0 communication. Very little guidance or even tooling is Available on integrating SORs into the AAS dataspace in a reusable and scalable way. This paper shows architectural solutions and concepts to narrow this gap, thus enabling quick integration of existing SORs with the AAS dataspace. Additionally, it provides an open-source implementation bridging this gap. Researchers and practitioners can benefit from the proposed architecture and implementation by applying various use cases of integrating SORs with AAS dataspace.",

        "Abstract": "With the rapid digital transformation of manufacturing, vast amounts of data are being generated and analyzed to uncover valuable patterns in areas such as energy efficiency, predictive maintenance, production scheduling etc. However, much of this data and the intelligence derived from it remain isolated within individual companies. This is strongly influenced by companies reluctance to share data due to concerns over privacy and security associated with the commercially sensitive information. As a result, the potential shared value that can be derived from a richer, larger pool of data and intelligence across multiple companies remains untapped. While solutions such as federated learning exist to address privacy and security issues, strong governance so that the privacy is preserved is crucial to its successful implementation. Currently, there is a lack of software infrastructure that guarantees data sovereignty and governance for data owners in this space. This paper introduces COllaboRative Data Space (CORDS), a framework that enables companies to engage in a machine learning model-sharing ecosystem, providing full control over the access and usage of their data. Aligned with the European Data Space initiative, CORDS aims to foster trusted collaboration by providing a software infrastructure constituting a set of tools for both intra and inter-organization data asset management and ML model exchange. To the best of our knowledge, CORDS is the first minimum viable data space (MVDS) designed to address the broader challenges of sovereignty, interoperability, compliance & governance in cross-party ML model sharing. This paper also highlights the value of data sharing by applying CORDS to a use-case focused on improving energy efficiency in manufacturing. Extensive performance evaluation showcases CORDS’ utility in securely managing data assets and facilitating machine learning model exchanges. CORDS is available as open-source software, supporting further research and practical applications of trusted data spaces in both academia and industry.",

Its applicability to the health domain was explored in the Gaia-X-Med project, which aimed to establish a common dataspace for various medical use cases based on Gaia-X principles. This paper presents a trust- and consent-based approach to the secure authentication and digital contract negotiation central to this endeavor and discusses the challenges that arose during the adoption of the Gaia-X framework, particularly relating to the strict requirements of the European healthcare domain with regards to privacy and consent regulations. By exploring the practical implications of Gaia-X in the healthcare context, this paper aims to contribute to the ongoing discussions surrounding the digital sovereignty of both citizens and corporations, as well as its realization via future Internet technologies.",

        "Abstract": "The cyber–physical systems (CPSs) of various stakeholders from the mobility, logistics, and security sectors are needed to enable smart and secure situational awareness operations in a port environment. The motivation for this research arises from the challenges caused by some unexpected events, such as accidents, in such a multi-stakeholder critical environment. Due to the scale, complexity, and cost and safety challenges, a simulation-based approach was selected as the basis for the study. Prototype-level experimental solutions for dataspaces for secure data sharing and visualization of situational awareness were developed. The secure data-sharing solution relies on the application of verifiable credentials (VCs) to ensure that data consumers have the required access rights to the data/information shared by the data prosumer. A 3D virtual digital twin model is applied for visualizing situational awareness for people in the port. The solutions were evaluated in a simulation-based execution of an accident scenario where a forklift catches fire while loading a docked ship in a port environment. The simulation-based approach and the provided solutions proved to be practical and enabled the smooth study of disaster-type situations. The realized concept of dataspaces is successfully applied here for both daily routine operations and information sharing during accidents in the simulation-based environment. During the evaluation, needs for future research related to perception, comprehension, projection, trust, and security as well as performance and quality of experience were detected. Especially, distributed and secure viewpoints of objects and stakeholders toward real-time situational awareness seem to require further studies.",

The society is ’forced’ to adapt itself to technological change and progress for setting the necessary skillsets for the workforce. In order to follow the digital transformation, it is necessary to evoke the reshaping, evolution, or replacement of traditional and possibly obsolete processes at intra- or inter-organizational levels in multiple aspects, introducing innovative ways of re-defining the workforce. To do so, the key piece are data. In this context various platform collect and organize data, also exploiting the new era of Data Spaces (DS). SKILLAB will act as a smart tool for handling, honing, and widening the competencies of the personnel of companies, forecasting future skill gaps and providing European citizens with a tool for upskilling and reskilling, exploiting DS.",

        "Abstract": "The European Health Data Space (EHDS) is a significant initiative within the European Union aimed at improving healthcare through better use of health data and collaboration. This involves sharing and utilization of health data in a secure and interoperable manner across EU member states. With the advent of modern technology, different types of health data are being acquired ranging from traditional electronic health records to real-time wearable signals for improved healthcare delivery and management. However, there are certain challenges associated with compliance to EHDS, such as secure continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD), scalability and adaptability towards new technologies and applications, tolerance against IoT cyber-attacks, requirement of advanced data storage methods, processing power, interoperability solutions for data analysis and connectivity. In order to address these, a flagship project of the European Commission, GATEKEEPER, represents a pioneering effort designed to transform healthcare delivery through the utilization of sophisticated digital technologies. The architecture of the GATEKEEPER platform has been meticulously crafted, in compliance with the EHDS, to integrate a multitude of data sources, deploying advanced analytical tools to enable the development of novel solutions for the effective prediction, detection, and management of chronic health conditions. GATEKEEPER addresses the aforementioned challenges by integrating collaborative tools for data management and consistency, machine learning modelling and management tool, activity feeds and issue tracking tools with developers authentication, CI/CD tools allowing, among others scalability in multiple formats, tools for assessing security, vulnerability and dependency for third party packages.",

        "Abstract": "In the rapidly evolving field of new energy, technological advancements and the expansion of application scopes have underscored the importance of effective data management and analysis. However, the new energy industry faces challenges such as the imbalance in spatial and temporal distribution and the significant impact of weather on the efficiency of wind and photovoltaic power. This study, based on the actual conditions of China’s new energy industry chain, proposes an innovative data space framework aimed at accelerating the development of the new energy sector. The framework features a modular design, offering a flexible, scalable, and user-friendly solution through key processes such as data analysis, data transmission, and data governance.At the onset of the research, core requirements for data management in the new energy field were identified through an in-depth analysis of the industry background. Based on these requirements, a four-layer architecture model was constructed, comprising the data layer, analysis layer, interaction layer, and server layer. To verify the practical feasibility of the designed framework, a comprehensive study of China’s new energy industry was conducted, and a series of empirical analyses confirmed the framework’s applicability and effectiveness in Chinese new energy projects. The data space framework proposed for the new energy field in this study is technically viable. Future research will focus on further optimizing and expanding the functions of the framework, with the aim of widespread implementation and application in a broader range of new energy scenarios.",

A data space solution can facilitate secure, interoperable data exchange among diverse stakeholders, fostering collaboration while ensuring data privacy and compliance. This paper aims to tackle the challenge of data exchange in the health domain by outlining the requirements, intended uses, key functionalities, and proposed services for implementing secure network sharing mechanisms within the data space ecosystem. Additionally, it investigates and compares existing minimum viable data spaces to identify the most suitable mechanism for developing a data space platform. The paper presents the development of an architectural framework for a data space-enabled platform designed for network-provisioned data exchange within the health data space. Finally, to validate the proposed data space architecture and services, several realistic scenarios are presented.",

This paper analyses the application of Data Space in smart transportation, emphasizing their key role in facilitating secure and private data sharing among different infrastructures. It introduces a novel architecture that overcomes the legal and technical challenges specific to this field. In particular, the first application of our analysis is the enhancement of the booking system for refuelling and recharging slots, which serves as a key example of a smart mobility application. By employing Data Spaces, transportation stakeholders can achieve a more coordinated and efficient scheduling process, reducing waiting times and enhancing user experience across all transport modes. This work highlights the significant potential of Data Spaces in creating a more integrated and interconnected transport ecosystem.",

        "Abstract": "The pulp and paper industry faces significant en-vironmental challenges, such as air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and wastewater discharge, requiring smarter and more sustainable operations. Regulatory bodies are imposing stringent measures to mitigate these impacts, prompting the industry to adopt sustainable practices and technologies. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) models are crucial in this effort, pro-viding a comprehensive evaluation of environmental impacts and aiding decision making for sustainable manufacturing. However, organisations prioritise the confidentiality of their sensitive data, which can hinder collaborative efforts and LCA calculations. This paper addresses organisational requirements for improving confidentiality, tamper-proof data transfer, and ensuring data sovereignty. The ongoing proof-of-concept introduces a novel approach in LCA, employing Secure Multiparty Computation (SMPC) and data spaces to enable confidentiality-preserving LCA. Our solution ensures data sovereignty and accurate LCA calculations, promoting sustainable practices across the value chain. This paper lays the foundation for a collaborative data platform that meets the critical needs of confidentiality, security, and sustainability in the process manufacturing industry.",

        "Abstract": "Building a “Common European Agricultural Data Space” lies among the high priorities of the European Commission for the agriculture sector following the directives of the recent European Strategy for Data. The aim is to create a single market for data, where data can flow within the EU and across sectors, for the benefit of all. Several authorities and approaches are in place for monitoring public and/or private agri-data and address the challenges of managing large-scale data infrastructures. However, what is missing is sufficient tools, models, and policies that would allow the seamless, transparent, and secure interoperation of existing agri-data infrastructures and platforms, which unfortunately remain isolated. While some attempts have been made to encourage interoperability, there are still major challenges to be addressed, both at technological and operational/business levels. On the technology side, one of the main barriers is due to the wide and heterogeneous landscape currently in place and the lack of dominant standardized solutions. This paper aims to present the main objectives and concepts of the DIVINE project, focusing on the mechanisms it provides for enabling agriculture policies monitoring based on smart farming data sharing and analytics, as well as adoption of various Internet of Things technologies.",

        "Abstract": "The capacity of Dataspace enables the distribution of heterogeneous data from several sources and domains and has attracted attention for resolving data integration challenges. Drone data sharing faces challenges such as protecting privacy and security, building trust and dependability, controlling latency and scalability, facilitating real-time data processing, and preserving the caliber of shared models. Therefore, sixth-generation (6G) networks provide high throughput and low latency to improve drone operations; security issues are exacerbated by the sensitive nature of shared data and the lack of centralized monitoring. To address the challenges, this paper presents a conceptual framework for a Dataspace in the Sky to enable secure and efficient drone data-sharing within 6G networks in the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0. The Dataspace in the Sky integrates Federated Learning (FL), a decentralized Machine Learning (ML) approach that enhances security and privacy by sharing models instead of raw data, facilitating effective drone collaboration. However, the quality of shared local models often suffers due to inconsistent data contributions and unreliable recording mechanisms, which can undermine the performance of FL. To tackle the challenges, the framework employs blockchain (BC) to decentralize and secure the Dataspace, ensuring the integrity of contribution records and improving the reliability of shared models. Dataspace in the Sky empowered decentralized data sharing which addresses latency issues by decentralizing decision-making and enhances trust and reliability by leveraging immutable and transparent BC mechanisms. The robustness of Dataspace in the Sky solution is not only secures drone-sharing operations in 6G environments but enables the development of citizen-friendly mobility services, expanding opportunities across smart environments.",

        "Abstract": "The automotive supply chain (ASC) is a complex system involving every aspect of automobile manufacturing, from which the data obtained features such as massive volume, diverse types, and complex relationships. Traditional data management methods no longer meet the demands of handling heterogeneous data from multiple sources or ensuring secure cross-domain data sharing in the ASC, which leads to the isolation of information. Therefore, this paper proposes a data management method based on Industrial Dataspace (IDS), constructs a dataspace architecture for the automotive supply chain (DS-ASC). On this basis, proposes a method for data relationship mining and trusted data sharing that considers implicit associations among ASC members. The improved BiLSTM model promotes the understanding of data, and the improved DPoS algorithm reduces the risk of data leakage. Our method is validated in the practical application of a supply chain master enterprise, and the experiments show that the method proposed in this paper is able to effectively improve the accuracy of mining data association relationship. Meanwhile, it is able to prevent single-point attacks, and ensure the security of data sharing.",

        "Abstract": "In many use cases, policies governing data access need to take time into account: for example, in logistics, the location of a delivery vehicle may only be exposed by a recipient for the duration of their delivery. The Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL) standard, a commonly used policy expressing language, does not support this type of dynamicity. Addressing these use cases requires support to express time-dependent constraints within policy languages, to enforce them in a continuous manner. We created a continuous, interoperable, and modular usage control enforcement framework for dynamic usage control policies, and extended ODRL to support dynamic values in a deterministic manner. This paper details the validation of our solution within a logistics use case. We show that, with a minimal change to ODRL, support for time-dependent constraints can be achieved. This work can provide the ODRL working group with the necessary input that will increase its adoption in domains that depend on time-dependent policies.",

Data sovereignty is tightly coupled with data security and therefore, with data usage control policy specification. In this paper, we propose an approach to facilitate the processes of policy specification by data owners, policy transformation from a technology-independent to a technology-dependent language, and policy negotiation between the parties who exchange their data. We extracted an enterprise relevant set of policy classes from the parties’ security requirements in order to implement an editor that supports users in creating their machine-readable policies. Then, we developed an algorithm that benefits from the policy classes and constructs technology-dependent security policy instances. In addition, we proposed a policy negotiation approach which is based on the parameters of the extracted policy classes.",

While ICV ecosystems are being developed on an application-specific basis, there is no standardised technical infrastructure for cross-company or cross-organizational applications. This paper presents a novel approach for federated ICV services, exemplified through the need for visual assembly inspection in the quality assurance process of passenger car production. The use cases include the automated training of computer vision models from synthetic data and the execution of the inspection service itself. A prototypical pipeline is designed to demonstrate the federated processing. The novelty of the approach is the application of the AAS (Asset Administration Shell) digital twin standard for the provisioning of service relevant data combined with the EDC (Eclipse Dataspace Connector) to ensure secure and self-sovereign data exchange.",

Apart from Data Spaces technology, the proposed framework innovates by leveraging also Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) and blockchain to enable secure, trustworthy, and sovereign data exchange between Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs) across borders. Specifically, it utilizes advanced PETs, including Large-Scale Biometric Data Indexing based on deep hashing techniques and Homomorphic Encryption to allow for suspect identification without disclosing sensitive information of personal biometric data. Thus, it enables LEAs to securely compare and exchange encrypted sensitive biometric data, including facial images, fingerprints and voiceprints, while maintaining data privacy and data sovereignty. LEAs define the usage rules for the biometic data they own and these rules are enforced to and respected by the other LEAs participating in the Biometrics Data Space. The proposed architecture is designed to be scalable, allowing the incorporation of additional biometric modalitiies and the easy expansion and integration with new participant LEAs.",

This publication presents and compares three approaches for managing Digital Twins in industrial use cases. For the aggregation of these approaches, a user-centered design approach has been used in the research project Catena-X which focuses on the automotive industry. The results are analyzed qualitatively based on aspects such as data ownership and data sovereignty. It was identified, that all three approaches have limitations and benefits which make them useful in different scenarios. An overview of their strengths and weaknesses is presented to select an appropriate approach In similar setups. The results described in this publication can be used to select the best update approach in data spaces where multiple stakeholders are able to update information on a single asset.",

Various benefits have recently been identified in the analysis of health data, encompassing applications such as diagnostics utilizing personal monitoring devices, analysis of electronic medical images, interpretation of laboratory test reports, and assistance in formulating health policies, all of which are pertinent to the healthcare system. However, the enactment of data protection laws in Brazil (LGPD) and the European Union (GDPR) has posed challenges in accessing patients' personal health data, consequently impeding progress in the field. The European Health Data Space (EHDS) initiative represents a novel standard for sharing health data for research purposes. One proposed solution to address this challenge is the Federated Learning (FL) architecture, a technique whereby algorithms process data locally and optimize training globally without transmitting sensitive data to external entities. Numerous open-source tools are available for deploying an FL environment, each characterized by distinct architectures, functionalities and cryptographic mechanisms. This article scrutinizes several opensource FL tools, comparing their functionalities in order to ensure compliance with privacy laws for integration into the EHDS framework. Finally, we provide concluding remarks and suggest potential avenues for future research.",

        "Abstract": "The objective of dataspaces is to facilitate seamless and reliable data exchange between different organizations. In Europe, their prominence has grown with the implementation of the European Data Governance Act. This legislation emphasizes the importance of trust, accessibility, and shared dataspaces, which necessitate semantic interoperability grounded in the FAIR principles. While semantic descriptions in the form of semantic models and ontologies are indispensable to dataspaces, their full potential remains unexploited. Meaningful metadata, including contextual information, enhances data usability, but the manual creation of semantic models can be challenging. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a new way to utilize data in dataspaces. Their advanced natural language processing capabilities enable context-aware data processing and semantic understanding. This paper presents initial experiments on customizing and optimizing LLMs for semantic labeling and modeling tasks. The contributions of this work include research questions for future investigations, early experiments demonstrating the applicability of LLM for semantic labeling, and proposed directions to address discovered challenges.",

        "Abstract": "Because of the importance of data-sharing for the economy, improved products and services, and to benefit society, the European Union has proposed developing a Common European Data Space (CEDS). The goal is to create a single European data market through 14 domain-specific data spaces (e.g., agriculture, or the Common European Agricultural Data Space (CEADS)). One of the central tenets of the CEDS is to ensure that those who share data can maintain control over who has access to, use of, and ability to share it (or ‘data sovereignty’). Data sovereignty is an umbrella concept with many different values comprising its implementation. Therefore, to successfully implement data sovereignty in the CEADS (and all CEDS for that matter), it is important to identify what values are important for stakeholders.This paper examines the CEADS to identify the most critical values for potential stakeholders of this data space. We implement a six-phase value-sensitive design methodology called ‘value mapping’ by interviewing stakeholders from an incipient Spanish data-sharing initiative (potentially representing over 1 million farmers) and conducting a workshop with 42 international stakeholders at an agri-tech summit. Our findings demonstrate the different values that are important for stakeholders of an agricultural data space: farmers (privacy, control, and trust); farm advisors (human welfare and autonomy); farmer associations (trust and human welfare); technology providers and intermediaries (autonomy and human welfare); public and regulatory bodies (autonomy); and society (justice). Furthermore, we describe different interdisciplinary steps to ensure and protect these values to ensure sovereignty-by-design in the CEADS.",

        "Abstract": "The Flanders Smart Data Space (VSDS in Dutch) is a pioneering initiative in the realm of data management, aiming to establish a comprehensive and interoperable data infrastructure in the region of Flanders (Belgium). With data being scattered across different sources using their own custom APIs and semantics, it is tedious for users to access and integrate the data. Data consumers are left depending on inefficient data integration processes, requiring custom code with low re-usability. VSDS aims to solve this problem by offering a uniform approach and a collection of reusable building blocks built upon Semantic Web technologies that aim to facilitate seamless data sharing and integration. This paper discusses the core concepts of VSDS, highlighting its role in breaking down data silos, towards a more collaborative and interoperable ecosystem. By reporting on the creation of the traffic measurements data space, a real and domain-driven application of the VSDS concepts, we illustrate how accessibility and interoperability can be enhanced, and the time needed for data integration can be lowered, enabling data consumers to shift their focus from the complexities of data integration to solving domain problems using this data. Future work will focus on expanding the scope of the Flanders Smart Data Space to include additional domains, further enhancing data interoperability and collaboration across different sectors. Furthermore, the Flanders Smart Data Space will continue to align with the existing international Data Space initiatives.",

Such federations can point towards each other using secured generally available public communication channels to exchange digital assets, like Digital Product Passport or Digital Calibration Certificates (DCCs). Given the complexity of information, its unique and differential character comprising different aspects of metrological and industrial requirements, its trustworthy and reliable presentation constitutes a real challenge, especially, if a state authority or a notified body claims an access to the content of a DCC. In our work this challenge is addressed in a framework of verifiable presentations realized by applications of W3C decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials in a federated international data spaces approach. To realize a verifiable presentation of DCC content on demand between two federations, a trust and identity work package of the Gaia-X along with its new trust management infrastructure (TRAIN) framework has been adapted. The proposed approach is readily scalable, extendable, and accessible to any authorized body and industrial partner or company.",

        "Abstract": "In today’s interconnected global landscape, the seamless circulation of data across borders has emerged as a pivotal factor underpinning the global economy, scientific research, and technological advancements. It is imperative to enable a secure data-sharing ecosystem that ensures trustworthiness, which, in the cross-border context, refers to traceability, accountability, and multiparty compliance. However, a significant challenge remains: the lack of a universally applicable framework tailored to these scenarios, one could provide a trust foundation and corresponding assurances. To address this, we have taken “traceable, accountable, and multiparty compliant data-sharing” as design principles and propose a Trans-border Trusted Data Spaces (TTDS) framework. TTDS adopts the International Data Spaces (IDS) information model used in EU data-sharing projects to ensure interoperability and leverage the existing tools and standards to establish trustworthiness of participant identities. Building upon this, the framework provides traceability and accountability for data usage through security features including IP layer traffic monitoring, zero-trust identity management, smart contracts, etc. It also offers multi-party compliance support through a natural language processing (NLP) based rule interpretation framework. Compared to existing data-sharing frameworks, TTDS provides a more reliable and general “infrastructure” tailored to the specific needs of cross-border scenarios. In this paper, we present the functional and technical architecture as well as the core components of TTDS. And then propose a system implementation based on IPv6 for the more urgently needed aspects of data traceability, empirically demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving robust traceability and provided effective evidence to support accountability.",

        "Abstract": "In contemporary urban environments, the federation of IoT-empowered data spaces is gaining ground as a concept, however a single unifying approach to federation is still elusive. As a result, the exchange of data across heterogeneous federated data spaces often encounters challenges, such as different data models and data exchange protocols, or stringent policies prohibiting data sharing across federations. This paper introduces CCDUIT, a software overlay architecture designed to address these issues, facilitating seamless cross-federation collaboration. As a comprehensive solution, CCDUIT offers modularity, scalability, and interoperability, enabling efficient and sovereignty-preserving data exchange across diverse federations. CCDUIT leverages rich property graph models for context modeling of federations, which are exchanged across federations via publish/subscribe topic schemes, with data sharing, and access control governed by policy mechanisms matching the topics. Our experimental results demonstrate that CCDUIT significantly reduces the complexity and effort involved in data management and sharing across federations, with a quantifiable decrease in operational overhead by approximately 40% to 60%. This streamlines collaboration while ensuring compliance with data sovereignty and sharing policies, providing a solution to a longstanding challenge in federation-based data ecosystems.",
